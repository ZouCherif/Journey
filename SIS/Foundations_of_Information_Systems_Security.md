# Foundations of Information Systems Security

## The challenges of Information Systems security

### What is an Information System?

Set of resources intended to collect, classify, store, manage, and disseminate information within an organization (The IS must facilitate the organization's mission)

An organization's information system contains a set of assets:

- **_Primary assets – the most important things_**

  _Business processes and information_ – the actual data and activities that give the organization its value.

- **_Supporting assets – everything that allows those primary assets to work_**
  - **Site** – offices, data centers, physical locations.
  - **People** – employees, contractors, anyone using or running the system.
  - **Hardware** – servers, computers, storage devices.
  - **Network** – internal and external connections.
  - **Software** – applications and operating systems.
  - **Organization** – procedures, management structures, and policies.

<span style="color: red;">**_Information system security means ensuring the security of all these assets._**</span>

### Challenges

The goal of security is to **_reduce risks_** to the information system, to **_limit their impact_** on the operations and business activities of organizations.

Information-system security management is not about creating obstacles, it enhances service quality for users and ensures staff receive the protection they deserve.

#### Which departments within a company are impacted by IS security?

Information-system security affects every major business area: finances, legal/regulatory compliance, organizational operations, and the company’s image and reputation.  
A breach can create financial loss, legal penalties, internal disruption, and damage to public trust.

#### Why are hackers interested in organizations' information systems or individuals computers?

Hackers go after companies and people to make money, like stealing and selling data, demanding ransom, or using computers for their own services.  
They also spy for businesses or governments and may threaten to leak or change information.
